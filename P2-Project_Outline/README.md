# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My idea is to provide an app that connects teachers with parents. Just like a canvas, where parents can check their kid's progress, being aware of their grades, coming projects and being able to communicate with teachers, and vice versa. 
Being a toddler's mother l realized that we need to communicate more with the people that take care of our children most of the day, no matter the age. This would be a great tool for divorced parents too, or the ones who live in different cities or even countries. They both need to know what's happening in their children's life.

### Features
Top features would be:
1.User Login (admin,teacher/parent)
2.Admin adds the teacher/parent user
3.Admin links teachers and parents to students
4.Chat in real time between teacher and parent of the student

### Technologies
l am going to create my project with C# MVC

### What I'll Have to Learn
l will have to learn how to implement the chat in my MVC.
l think l will use SignalR
